Small project I did in python on Reinforcement Learning.

It is heavily inspired by this paper : [https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/uploads/Research/Overview/FinalSubmission-1.pdf](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9832941)https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9832941
This article discusses the importance of using autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) for the observation and study of the ocean environment.

I have created a python simulation of two AUVs, one with random movements and the other driven by Reinforcement Learning to align with the first.
I used the same reward function as the one described in the article, but of course I simplified the environnement.
This is my first attempt at working with Reinforcement Learning and I found it very interesting.
